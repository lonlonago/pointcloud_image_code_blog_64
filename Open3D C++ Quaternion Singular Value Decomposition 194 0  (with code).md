##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Overview of the principle 

  The singular value decomposition of a quaternion matrix is to decompose a quaternion matrix into the product of three parts, namely: where, is a quaternion matrix, and is two unitary matrices, is a quaternion matrix with real and non-negative elements on the diagonal, and * represents the conjugate of the quaternion. The SVD of a quaternion matrix can be realized by an iterative algorithm. Specifically, the Jacobi iteration method can be used to calculate the singular value decomposition of a quaternion matrix. The Jacobi iteration method is an algorithm that gradually diagonalizes a matrix by rotating the matrix. In the SVD of a quaternion matrix, it is also possible to iteratively rotate the matrix and gradually diagonalize it to obtain, and. It is important to note that the SVD of a quaternion matrix is different from the SVD of a real matrix. In the SVD of a real matrix, sums are both orthogonal matrices, while in the SVD of a quaternion matrix, sums are both quaternion matrices and are not necessarily orthogonal. 

###  2. The implementation process 

The steps of the Q-SVD algorithm are as follows: 

  Although the computational complexity of the Q-SVD algorithm is high, it shows excellent performance in computing the singular value decomposition of quaternion matrices. Therefore, the Q-SVD algorithm has been widely used in computer graphics, computer vision and other fields.
