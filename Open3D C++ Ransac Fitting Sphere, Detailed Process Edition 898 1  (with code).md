##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Calculation process 

  Space spherical equation: Formula (1) can be written as: let, then formula (2) is simplified as: write formula (3) in the form of a matrix, as shown in (4): solve the parameters to be obtained, substitute them, to obtain the coordinates of the spherical center of space and the radius of the spherical sphere.
