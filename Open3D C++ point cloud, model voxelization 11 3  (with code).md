##  Voxel 

  Point clouds and triangular meshes are very flexible but irregular geometric types. Voxel meshes are another type of geometry in 3D that is defined on a regular 3D mesh, and voxels can be thought of as 3D counterparts of 2D pixels. VoxelGrid in Open3D, can be used to work with voxel meshes.

 ```  
  Implement the creation of a voxel mesh from a point cloud. A voxel is occupied if at least one point of the point cloud is within that voxel. The color of the voxel is the average of all points within the voxel. The parameter voxel_size defines the resolution of the voxel mesh.
