##  First, the principle of the algorithm 

###  1. Nature 

An ideal Poisson disk sampling point set needs to satisfy three conditions: 

  The sampling method that satisfies these three conditions is called maximized Poisson disc sampling. The effect after sampling is good, which can satisfy the uniform data points, retain the details better, and have better blue noise characteristics. The algorithm has a large time complexity

 ```  
The function samples points from the grid, where each point is approximately the same distance from its neighbors (blue noise).
